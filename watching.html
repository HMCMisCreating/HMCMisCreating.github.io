     <h2>   Sandman (2025)</h2><br>
     <p> I've finished watching the first part of the ~final~ season of Netflix's Sandman.
      This is a tough topic, as the public outcry for the author to face justice is still ongoing - and yes, by
      facing justice I mean, hopefully, he does time in jail.... BUT, that's the tough thing! How do you separate the art 
      from the author??? In this instance!? Where the author is so thoroughly embedded in the work :/

     <p>Honestly, at this point the only thing keeping me interested in this whole
      thing, besides the amazing acting and the really cool production design, is 
      the very small chance that there's going to be a cameo from the Dead boy detectives
      themselves at some point! <br>
      My gawd! I'm hopeful and excited for that!
